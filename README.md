  <BODY><p>Hi, I am Samantha M. Wathen-Olson (<b>@SamanthaWathenOlson</b>). Pleased to meet you. I have been hired by Revature. I Have madeit half way through training and still doing well. My banking app was not as stellar but my second app is quite different. I had great teammates that really know what to do. I will definitely use this project to grow on and learn more. It still has been quite daunting the coding that needs to be done. I am focusing on coding faster. Our classes have coding challenges and I do poorly on most of them. I am working on my fault for now. </p>
    <p>I intend to continue to study the example codes and figure out what I can create with these languages. I understand HTML, Python, and Javascript. And I am learning about Java now, but I intend to learn Ruby, and NodeJS. I hope to grow my knowledge in more computer languages in the future. My favorite past time is to listen to music, draw artwork, enjoy food, watch anime, and experience various subjects.</p>
