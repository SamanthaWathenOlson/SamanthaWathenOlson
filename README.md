  </HEAD>
  <BODY>Hi, I am Samantha M. Wathen-Olsom. Pleaseed to meet you. I am a new professional in the cyber security field. My curiousity is peaked and I can't wait to do some amazing things here on this platform. I currently do not feel comfortable doing collaborative projects till I have had more time to grow. I know that I have not had much experience, but I hope to investigate that further here. I currently have proects that are copied from a few ideas online. I intend to study the code and figure out what I can create with these languages. I am learning about Javascript for now, but I intend to learn Ruby, and NodeJS. I intend to learn more languages.
