  <BODY><p>Hi, I am Samantha M. Wathen-Olson (<b>@SamanthaWathenOlson</b>). Pleased to meet you. I have been hired by Revature. I am learning new things about being a Dev. They have seen the potential in me to do more. I intend to rise to the occasion and reach for my potential. I seem to be more calm when I am creating things. And now, by a stroke of my own talents, I have been given the ability to do so. I am excited to try something new and expand my horizons, which I hope to continue to do.</p>
    <p>My curiousity is peaked and I can't wait to do some amazing things here on this platform. I currently do not feel comfortable doing collaborative projects till I have had more time to grow. I know that I have not had much experience, but I hope to investigate that further here. I have projects that are copied from a few ideas online. I intend to study the code and figure out what I can create with these languages. I understand HTML and Python. And I am learning about Javascript, but I intend to learn Ruby, and NodeJS. I hope to grow my knowledge in more computer languages in the future. My favorite past time is to listen to music, draw artwork, enjoy food, watch anime, and experience various subjects.</p>
