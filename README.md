    <H1>My Journey to Cyber Security Confidence</H1>

  <BODY>Hi, I am Samantha M. Wathen-Olson (@SamanthaWathenOlson). Pleased to meet you. I am a new professional in the cyber security field. My curiousity is peaked and I can't wait to do some amazing things here on this platform. I currently do not feel comfortable doing collaborative projects till I have had more time to grow. I know that I have not had much experience, but I hope to investigate that further here. I have projects that are copied from a few ideas online. I intend to study the code and figure out what I can create with these languages. I understand HTML and Python. And I am learning about Javascript, but I intend to learn Ruby, and NodeJS. I hope to grow my knowledge in more computer languages in the future. My favorite past time is to listen to music, draw artwork, enjoy food, watch anime, and experience various subjects.
